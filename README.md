# Math_Hand_Written_Problems_Solver
This application was part of a team project we worked on as part of the Project R course. The goal was to familiarize ourselves with computer vision and the technologies applied in that field. The basic functionalities are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>The user inputs an image of handwritten, binary mathematical operations (e.g., 4+12, 124/4).</li>
  <li>If the model recognizes all elements in the image, it displays the result; otherwise, it notifies the user of an error.</li>
</ul>
